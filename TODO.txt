--- # TO-DO
- Include evolving sprite for sorenBot 
    he currently opens his mouth when text is being written, however it stays open during the pause after a comma or a period.
    if i ever decide to return to this, i would like to adjust his eyes to different outcomes as well, similar to the situational text lines.
- Debug text interaction. Most work, however some trigger at innapropriate times.
    in particular (10)
- make a better logo or background. looks god awful. maybe go crazy with it and put a gif of fire.
- add a footer, probably.
- grey out player buttons to be unusable until the player has completed reading sorens text.
- grey out player buttons when playersHealth.value = 0
- implement a "replay" button to reset player health, without having to click through sorens initial text.
- debug the "null beats null" situation.
- change health bar colors to green.
- implement a purple glow to a button when hovered over.
- custom cursor?

--- # Completed
- Include an "HP" bar.
- actually have a css file :)
- Stylize buttons, import logos.
- Create a text box for the webpage to announce from.
- added a resources folder.
- Import enemy sprite
- Write JS to make the text "write out" on the screen.
- Write text interaction based on game results.
- I instead chose to use a font /similar/ to the tellius one.
